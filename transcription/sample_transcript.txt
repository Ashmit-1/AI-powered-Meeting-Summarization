Employer:\nHi Sarah, thanks for joining the meeting today. I wanted to go over some tasks that we need to prioritize for the next sprint. How’s everything going on your end?\n\nSoftware Engineer (Sarah):\nHey! Everything’s going well. I’ve been working on the user authentication module, and I’m almost done with the basic login flow. Just a few bugs to iron out.\n\nEmployer:\nGreat to hear. So, for the next task, I want to assign you the development of the new feature for the reporting dashboard. We’ve had some feedback from the sales team that the dashboard is a bit lacking when it comes to filtering and custom reports.\n\nSarah:\nGot it. So, they want better filtering options and the ability to generate custom reports?\n\nEmployer:\nExactly. We want to make it so that users can select different criteria for their reports—date ranges, product categories, and maybe even customer segments. Also, we’ll need to allow them to save and export those reports in various formats, like CSV or PDF.\n\nSarah:\nSounds good. Do you have any specific UI/UX guidelines in mind for the new features?\n\nEmployer:\nYes, I’ll send you the mockups that the design team came up with. But overall, it should be pretty simple and intuitive. The goal is to give the users more flexibility without overwhelming them. We’ll need to focus on performance as well, especially for larger datasets.\n\nSarah:\nUnderstood. Is there a deadline for this feature?\n\nEmployer:\nIdeally, we’d like to have it ready for the next release cycle, which is in about three weeks. But if you need more time, just let me know.\n\nSarah:\nI’ll start with the back-end work, then. I assume we’ll be integrating it with our current database and querying system?\n\nEmployer:\nYes, exactly. You’ll likely need to work with the current reporting APIs, but we’ll need some optimizations on the back end to handle the new filters and the report saving functionality.\n\nSarah:\nAlright, I’ll start by reviewing the current code and the API endpoints. Anything else you need me to consider?\n\nEmployer:\nI think that covers it for now. Just keep me updated with your progress, and if you hit any blockers, feel free to ping me. We’ll also have a check-in midweek to see how things are going.\n\nSarah:\nSounds good. I’ll dive into it and let you know if I need anything.\n\nEmployer:\nAwesome, thanks Sarah. I’m looking forward to seeing the progress.\n\nSarah:\nNo problem, happy to help
