 All right, everyone, let's get started. First off, how's everyone doing? Steve, Chris, did you guys survive Monday? Man, barely. I woke up and immediately regretted all my weekend choices. But yeah, I'm here. Chris, how about you? Oh, same here. I stayed up way too late gaming last night. My sleep schedule is a disaster at this point. Huh, I don't know why I expected anything different from you two. Anyway, let's get to work before this turns into a therapy session. Now, let's go over our progress. Steve, can you update us on the front-end work? Sure. So the homepage UI is almost complete, but I still need to fix some responsiveness issues. Also, I was trying out a new font style, but I think we should discuss if we want to change it. Chris, I'll need some AP-I endpoint soon so I can integrate authentication. Sounds good, Steve. Try to finalize those fixes by Friday. Chris, how's back-end development going? Not bad. I've completed the database schema and the user authentication API is 80% done. I just need to test it. Also, Steve, I saw your UI design looking sleek, but let's make sure it aligns the backend structure. I'll send you the API documentation by tomorrow. Appreciate it, Chris. And yeah, I'll review the back-end structure. the docs once you send them. Awesome! By the way, have either of you tested the site on mobile yet? Yeah, I did a quick test. Looks fine on most devices, but some buttons get misaligned on smaller screens. Wait, I thought we agreed to make it responsive from the start? Steve, don't make me write an extra API just to fix your buttons. Ha ha ha ha, chill. Chris, I'm on it. It'll be fixed by tomorrow.
