 Hey Alex, how's everything going today? Surviving the craziness of the week? Just about, but I'm hanging in there. You know, just another day in the office. What's up, Emma? What do we need to tackle today? Well, we need to organize a team building outing. It's been a while since we've done something fun together. And I think it'll be great for morale. Any thoughts on what kind of activity we should do? Ooh, I'm down for that. How about a bowling night? It's easy and fun. But if you want something different, we could also try. a trivia night. What do you think? I love the idea of bowling. It's simple and everyone can join in. How's the budget looking for this? We should keep it low-key. I'd say we keep it under $300. I'll check out some local spots and make sure they offer food and drinks too. I'll send you a few options to pick from. Sounds perfect. Once we decide, can you also create the invite and send it out to the team? Let's aim for next Friday if possible. Got it. I'll confirm that. the spot, send the invite and make sure everyone RSVPs. Who, I'm so excited now. Can't wait for the outing. Same. Thanks, Alex. Let's make this happen. You got it, Emma. I'll get to work on it now.
