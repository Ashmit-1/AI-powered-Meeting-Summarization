 All right, thanks for joining the meeting, John. As we discussed earlier, we need to finalize the report for the quarterly review, and there are a few tasks I need your help with. Let's go over them. Of course, I'm ready. What do you need me to do? Great. First, I need you to gather all the sales data from the last quarter. The sales team has already sent their numbers, but we need to compile everything into one document for the finance department. Sure, I'll start compiling the data this afternoon. Is there a specific format? you'd like me to follow? Yes, I'd prefer it in the same format as last quarter. Use the template from the shared drive. Once you've compiled the data, please send it over to the finance team by Friday. Got it. I'll have that ready by Friday. What else? Next, I need you to coordinate with Sean Mukherjee, the marketing head, to get their input on the quarterly presentation. They have some updated graphics and charts that we need to include. Please reach out to them by tomorrow and and get their feedback. Understood. I'll reach out to Sean tomorrow morning. Perfect. Lastly, can you also update the project management tool? We need to make sure that all the tasks are properly assigned and up to date for the upcoming project. I've noticed a few tasks that are still not assigned to anyone. Okay, I'll go through the tool and update the assignments by the end of the day. Thanks. I appreciate it. Once you've completed everything, please send me enough to you. please send me an update and we'll have a final review before submitting the report. If you need anything else, don't hesitate to reach out. Sure thing. Have a good day, ma'am.
