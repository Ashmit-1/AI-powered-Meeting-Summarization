Alright, I need to figure out how to respond to the user's request. They want me to act as a meeting summarizer API that generates a JSON summary without any extra keys. They provided a specific schema: {"summary": "", "todo_work": [{"assignee": "", "work": [""]}]}. 

First, I'll look at the meeting transcript. It starts with some small talk about how everyone is doing after the weekend. Then, Steve gives an update on the front-end work, mentioning the homepage UI is almost done but has responsiveness issues. He also brought up a new font style that needs discussion. Chris then talks about the back-end progress, the database schema, and the user authentication API being 80% complete. He needs to test it and will send API docs to Steve. There's also a discussion about mobile responsiveness and button alignment issues.

So, for the summary, I need to capture the main points: progress on front-end and back-end, the need for design discussion, and the mobile responsiveness issue. 

Next, the todo_work section. Assignees are Steve and Chris. Steve needs to fix responsiveness and finalize UI fixes by Friday. He also needs to review the back-end structure once Chris sends the docs. Chris has to test the authentication API and send the docs to Steve. Also, there's a note about not needing an extra API for buttons, which is a reminder to fix the alignment issues.

I need to structure the JSON accordingly, making sure to follow the schema strictly without adding any extra keys. Each task under todo_work should have an assignee and a list of work items. 

I should double-check the JSON to ensure it's correctly formatted and only includes the specified keys. No markdown, just plain JSON. Also, make sure the summary is concise and covers all the key points from the meeting.

Finally, present the JSON as the response, ensuring it meets the user's requirements exactly.
