Alright, so the user has given me a query where they want me to act as a meeting summarizer API. They specified that the response should be in JSON format, strictly following a certain schema without any extra keys. The schema includes a "summary" field and a "todo_work" array with specific sub-fields.

First, I need to understand the user's exact requirements. They provided an example of a meeting conversation between Alex and Emma. My task is to generate a summary and list of action items based on that conversation.

Looking at the conversation, the main points are planning a team-building outing. They discussed options like bowling or trivia night, decided on bowling, set a budget under $300, and assigned tasks like finding a spot, sending invites, and confirming RSVPs.

I should extract the key decisions and actions. The summary needs to be concise, capturing the main goal of the meeting. For the todo_work, each task should have an assignee and a description. I need to make sure each task is a separate object within the array.

I also need to adhere strictly to the JSON schema provided. That means no extra keys outside of "summary" and "todo_work". Each todo item should have "assignee" and "work" fields, with "work" being an array of strings, even if there's only one task.

I should avoid any markdown and keep the JSON properly formatted. Let me structure the summary to reflect the planning of the outing and the budget. Then, list each action item with the responsible person.

Double-checking to ensure all tasks from the conversation are included and correctly assigned. Alex is handling the venue options, Emma is creating the invite, and both are confirming RSVPs. 

Finally, I'll format the JSON accordingly, making sure it's clean and follows the specified structure without any additional keys or formatting issues.
